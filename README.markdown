***A tool to help you generate "favicons" for your website.*** :hammer_and_pick:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/fi/actions/workflows/python.yaml/badge.svg)

## About :books:

Since I write a lot of websites, and the tool I normally use to generate `favicons` may not always be available, I decided to write my own tool to generate `favicons`. This is that tool.

## Usage :pick:

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3+
- Pillow for Python 3+ (`python3 -m pip install pillow`)
- Colorama for Python 3+ (`python3 -m pip install colorama`)
- Git

- 1.) Download the tool from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamtheblackunicorn/fi/main/src/fi.py).
- 2.) Take an icon you have created for your website. (Should be square and a `*.png` image.)
- 3.) Place the tool and your base image in the same directory.
- 4.) Run one of these commands according to what you want to do:
```bash
$ python3 fi.py --source mypng.png
```
- 5.) Place the generated `favicons` in your website's `assets` directory.
- 6.) Enjoy! :)
